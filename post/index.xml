      <description>References:
 https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/ https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/  Git Flow Git flow is multiple things.

On the other side its a branching model that gives you advice on handling your branching system in git repos.
First I&amp;rsquo;d like to show the git extensions so that we have that out of the way
Installation of Git Extensions bash Installation    MacOS Homebrew brew install git-flow-avh Macports port install git-flow-avh Linux apt-get install git-flow Windows Cygwin wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.</description>
