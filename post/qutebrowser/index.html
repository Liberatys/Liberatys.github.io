    <p><strong>Why I think that we should all ban our mouse from the workflow.</strong></p>

<h1 id="qutebrowser--what-is-that">Qutebrowser ? What is that</h1>
<p>The qutebrowser is a very cool browser that has been around for some time.
What is different about qutebrowser and separates it from other browsers, is that it is mostly
driven by keybindings and your beloved vim keys.</p>
<p>For instance, I do not have to move my mouse from the page to the status bar in order to insert
a new url. I can just hit &lsquo;o&rsquo; and get a prompt where I can insert a new url and search for stuff.</p>
<p>I am a developer right ? So why not hit &ldquo;w i&rdquo; and open my developer tools.</p>
<p>You want to add a new bookmark ? Oh let me search the little icon in my opera instance and then ?
Where is that bookmark icon again ? Hmmm I do not know the keybinding to create a bookmark in
opera.</p>
<p>But I know my sweet vim keys. So let me just hit my &ldquo;my&rdquo; key and I get a prompt to create a new
bookmark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The m key acqually doesn&rsquo;t create a bookmark, it creates a quickmark. Which is like a named
mark in vim. But I prefer them to bookmarks so I just call them bookmarks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a well I sometimes have to use the mouse to click a button.. what a shame&hellip;
O wait a second.. I don&rsquo;t have to ^^. By hitting &lsquo;f&rsquo; I can see all the possible
&ldquo;click surfaces&rdquo; and then can chose one of them with different bindings that are shown in a flashy
yellow on the screen.</p>
<p>The quotebrowser also supports the usage of key combinations that may span multiple keys.
If you can only remember the first letter of that combination (which more often that not has something
to do with the actual action you want to execute) the browser will show you a list of all bindings
that start with that letter. So if you hit &ldquo;w&rdquo; you see all bindings that start with w.
Thus it acts like the which-key plugin in vim or emacs.</p>
<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>As developers we are familiar with code. But most often we do not get the source code for our browser&hellip;
With the qutebrowser that is not the case.
You get all the code.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser">Qutebrowser on Github</a></p>
<h1 id="but-why-should-i-drop-opera-chrome-etc">But why should I drop opera, chrome etc.</h1>
<p>Well first of all, it will make you look very cool. Developing, browsing and not using a mouse&hellip;
<strong>oh wow that must be 1337 himself.</strong></p>
<p>But it will also help you keep the focus and not loose sight of your current task at hand.
Because, at least for me, every time I use the mouse my brain seems to switch context and
changes the way I think about the next operation I&rsquo;m about to make.</p>
<p>But if I use my bindings everywhere I go, I can remain focused and not switch context.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-switched-to-quotebrowser-and-other-binding-based-systems">Why I switched to quotebrowser and other binding based systems</h2>
<p>About two years ago I broke the fifth bone in my right hand and had to wear a cask for 2 months.
Now, two years later, I don&rsquo;t have any lasting damage from this injury. But whenever I have to touch
a mouse, my hand starts to hurt. I believe it is due to the metal pins in my bone somehow being pushed
against the mouse, where as my keyboard does not put preasure on my hand bones.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I learned some time ago that most mice are not meant to be hold in your hand for
an extended period of time. Most of them are non ergonomic and will put tension on your wrist.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-still-use-opera-chrome-etc">Why I still use opera, chrome etc.</h1>
<p>I get that most of your clients and users will not be using qutebrowser and thus you will have to
use a different browser to develop and test your applications. I also get that for most developers
the switch to a new browser will seem non trivial. Leaving all your plugins behind and moving on
to a new blank landscape.</p>
<p>But I believe that switching from an IDE to Vim and switching from opera, chrome to qutebrowser will
increase your focus and remove the bottleneck of using a mouse that will hinder you to translate your
thought into code or navigation actions.</p>
<p>I still have to test my javascript and css on opera and other modern browsers&hellip; but I think that event that
can be mitigate by tools like <a href="https://www.browserstack.com">BrowserStack</a>. But I haven&rsquo;t made the switch yet.</p>
<p>At work I use opera and also firefox. I have to.. because we develop applications for the web ^^
and the web looks different on different browsers :D. But maybe browserstack is something that is
able to help me out in that situation.</p>
<h1 id="the-end">The end</h1>
<p>Thank you for reading ^^.
This will be one of a series of posts that I will make that are related to utilities, vim and other
terminal stuff.</p>
